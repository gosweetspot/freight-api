# Create Shipments

    POST api/shipments

## Description
This method is used to create new shipments.

There are 2 pre-conditions that need to be considered before calling this method.
1. Does your workflow require you to display/calculate the freight costs and options prior to creating the shipment?
2. Does your workflow already know which carrier is to be used for creating the shipment?


#### 1. Display/Calculate rates first
In this scenario, you need to call the [AvailableRates](https://github.com/gosweetspot/freight-api/blob/master/ratesqueryv1/POST_availablerates.md) method first to resolve the different price options you may have.  Every option is accompanied by a **QuoteId** which needs to be retain to be used with the create shipment method.

#### 2. Create by Carrier Name and service
In this scenario, you won't know the cost of the freight for the shipment till after the shipment is created.  You will request the shipment to be used by specifying the carrier name, and service.


**Printing-**  if the access_key has an associated printer setup, the print job is activated by default.  This can be turned off by specifying *PrintToPrinter="false"*

***

## Requires authentication
* A valid access key must be provided in `access_key` request header.
* If the user with the access_key has access to multiple sites in the account, a `site_id` HTTP header with the site id is also required.

***

## Example 5 - Shipment with Pre-Rated pricing

Prior to creating shipments, you can use the **[<code>POST</code> api/rates](rates/post.md)** method to get the possible rate options.  If you would like to utilise one of these options, your workflow will be somewhat different.

1. Call **[<code>POST</code> api/rates](rates/post.md)** to get the available rate options. Each rate contains a *QuoteId*, retain this.
2. By some process of selection, identify the rate to use from (1) and get the *QuoteId*
3. Now call the current *api/shipments* method to generate a new shipment using the rates associated to the *QuoteId*. On the request message provide an additional property *QuoteId* with its value.

Note: When a *QuoteId* is not provided, the *Carrier* and *Service* properties are used to auto-rate and select the carrier/service to create against.  If either of this values are not provided the request will fail. The properties *Carrier* and *Service* can be wildcarded with '*' which will resolve to the first available rate, prioritising on cheapest first.
